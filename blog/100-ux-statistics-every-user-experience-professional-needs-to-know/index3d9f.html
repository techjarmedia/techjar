<ul>
<li>Research shows that, on average, every <strong>$1</strong> invested in UX brings <strong>$100</strong> in return. That’s an ROI of a whopping <strong>9,900%</strong>.</li>
<li>The top companies leading in user experience outperformed the S&amp;P index by <strong>35%</strong>.</li>
<li>A well-designed user interface could raise your website’s conversion rate by up to a <strong>200%</strong>, and a better UX design could yield conversion rates up to <strong>400%</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If you utilize UX design to satisfy enough people to boost your customer retention by as little as <strong>5%</strong>, you will be rewarded with a profit increase of at least <strong>25%</strong>.</li>
<li>Companies that were less invested in UX (they considered themselves simply “design-centric”) still saw their sales increase by <strong>60%</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A 2016 design study of <strong>408</strong> different companies found that the more a company invested in and focused on design, the more sales they saw.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>23%</strong> of customers who had a positive experience told <strong>10</strong> or more people about it.&nbsp;</li>
<li>When UX improves the customer experience, it raises a company’s KPIs up to <strong>83%</strong> in conversion lift.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>8</strong> in <strong>10</strong> customers are willing to pay more for better customer experience.</li>
