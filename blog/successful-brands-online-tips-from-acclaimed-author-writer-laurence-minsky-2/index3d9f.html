</ul>
<h2>What advice do you have for companies who are struggling to market their brand online?</h2>
<p>You need to think carefully about your goals and objectives, because it's not enough to be profitable, companies also need grow. Start by asking yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who you are as a brand, and what is the problem you are trying to overcome?</li>
<li>Does your current strategy connect to customer needs?</li>
<li>What competitive advantage or key assets does your company have?</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Messages are not one way anymore, they are conversations. You have to listen to what your customers are saying and you have to be able to respond them. As technology advances, your customers can choose the information they want, so you have come up with new ways of getting their attention, and there’s a lot of competition.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span>With so many companies shifting their efforts toward digital arenas, companies need to focus their marketing efforts on what business objectives they are trying to achieve. You have to figure out who your customers are and what they want, and that will help you understand what motivates them, and how to deliver it. To be a truly successful brand, creating valuable experiences is key no matter what context is being used to deliver your message (YouTube, Pandora, Blogs, Social Networks, etc.).</span></p>
