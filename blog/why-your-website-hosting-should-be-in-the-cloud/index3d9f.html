          <span><p><amp-img src="../../hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/iStock_000022244123Small2-3.jpg" class="hidden-featured" width="603.0" height="390.0" layout="responsive"></amp-img>With the internet evolving day after day, we hear of new discoveries and even better ways to surf and host files online. We have all heard of the term “cloud hosting” or hosting within the “cloud”. Is there really an object called the cloud? And what does it really do in terms of file hosting? Cloud hosting has been considered as a faster, and more reliable alternative to the traditional hosting. There are a lot of companies offering cloud hosting solutions promising to provide the hottest trend in the hosting market, but before anything else, what is cloud hosting and why is it better than other alternative hosting services?</p>

<h2><strong>What is cloud hosting?</strong></h2>
<p>The “Cloud”&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;a gadget, or a part of a computer that is used to store files and information. There really is no single physical object &nbsp;when it comes to defining the cloud. The divide and rule concept is used in cloud hosting wherein more than one web server is used to maintain your website. In traditional hosting, downtimes can be a problem because if one server fails to work the entire website will be in trouble. In cloud hosting, when it comes to server malfunction you have lesser chances of experiencing downtime since there is more than one server maintaining your website. The group of servers working together to maintain your website is commonly called the “cloud”. It helps that more than one server acts as a resource for your website and comes in handy especially during peak loads.</p>
<h2><strong>Dedicated Servers, VPS, and Cloud Hosting</strong></h2>
<p>For bigger companies, server reliability is important especially if a website needs to be up and running 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. There will be times where the website experiences peak loads and bandwidth issues may arise. But when this happens the server might not be able to handle it and may experience downtime, which is one of the things that companies avoid the most. If you are looking for reliable hosting services, cloud hosting is definitely your best choice. Especially for websites who experience a lot of hits per day, it is vital that the website is up and running at all times. One of the biggest factors that help people decide is the price. Since cloud hosting has a higher reliability rate due to the fact that there are more servers working on a single website, the price may be slightly higher compared to traditional shared hosting. Traditional shared hosting and VPS are known to have lower price rates but the reliability factor is always in question. For startup companies and websites which do not expect that much hits, a smaller budget for a hosting service and a lower reliability rate could be acceptable.</p>
<h2><strong>Benefits of using cloud hosting</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Less risks. </strong>When it comes to cloud hosting, one of the bigger advantages is the lowered risk of data loss. Since most of the data is stored in remote locations paired with quick backups, there is very little chance that you will experience any type of data loss. Also, companies that offer cloud hosting usually have customer and technical support that work round the clock, 24 hours and 7 days a week, to ensure that all problems are solved no matter what time of the day it is.</li>
<li><strong>Web traffic is not a problem. </strong>Since maintenance requirements of your website is spread across multiple servers, your website can easily handle huge web traffic which results to less or no downtime at all. With this type of hosting there are less server crashes making it easier for prospective and future clients to browse without any interruption.</li>
<li><strong>Customize size and storage with ease. </strong>Cloud hosting is known to have multiple or unlimited network of servers. By using cloud hosting you can easily create as much capacity as you want.</li>
